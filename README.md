# Sapsan


 - name='test'
>> Name of the run, as it will show up in the scores.dat and stats.dat
 - parameters=None
>> parameters (e.g. features) to train on. The last one in the array will be the target feature.
 - path='/raid1/JHTDB'
>> path to the data
 - dataset='iso'
>> which data set to use; options are 'iso' for HD turbulence, and 'mhd' for MHD turbulence
 - savepath='Figures'
>> where to save the data
 - test=False
>> set to True if want to randomly split the same data into training and testing set.
 - alpha=None
>> will use the default KRR alpha
 - gamma=None
>> will use the default KRR gamma
 - dim=128
>> dimension of the training set
 - max_dim=512
>> initial dimension of the data file, from which training and testing sets will be extracted
 - step=None
>> spatial separation between each data point used for training
 - t=[0]
>> training timestep
 - ttest=[0]
>> testing timestep
 - dt=2.5e-3
>> numeral value for dt to calculate the actual time of each timestep
 - fm=15
>> number of modes to filter down to
 - filtname='spectral'
>> filter to use; available options also include 'boxfilt'
 - tnc=2
>> which tensor component to predict; can be set to 0, 1, or 2
 - axis=2
>> dimensionality; either 2 or 3
 - from3D=False
>> extracts 2D slice from 3D data; only relevant if axis=2
 - outliers=False
>> only include outliers when adding consecutive steps, thus the data from additional timesteps won't be sampled in the same way as the 1st timestep.
